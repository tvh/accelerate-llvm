-- | A 'Function' is a worker that executes captured JIT compiled functions.
--
-- Note: [Executing JIT-compiled functions]
--
-- We have the problem that all the llvm-general functions dealing with the FFI
-- are expressed as bracketed 'with*' operations. This is a good design, because
-- it ensures functions clean up their resources when they exit. However, it
-- makes it impossible to return the compiled code from inside the bracketed
-- function, because it will no longer be valid once we try to execute it. For
-- good performance, we really do not want to have to lower all the way from the
-- pure AST into machine code every time we want to execute a function.
--
-- This function wrapper provides a way around it. The initial lowering step
-- that compiles into machine code is spawned into a separate thread. This
-- lowering includes all the bracketed functions as discussed above. However
-- instead of returning straight away, the thread then loops waiting for
-- requests to execute the compiled functions. Only once we signal to the thread
-- that it can exit, does the thread exit the bracketed functions, allowing
-- resources to be cleaned up.
